#+TITLE: John Tait's DocBook project

A fun indexing project using DocBook 5.2 to make the Richard Adams' epic lapine novel /Watership Down/ accessible:
 - chapter *abstracts* to summarize the story
 - a *glossary* to explain characters, places, lapine language terms, mythical aspects, and other concepts
 - a detailed *index* with
   - links to the chapter abstracts
   - pages numbers of the print edition.

This might be extended in the futurie to other fun novels like Frank Herberts /Dune/ etc.
