*by John Tait*

A supplement to the classic rabbit epic /Watership Down/ by the late Richard Adams: a full index to the print version and a glossary.

/Watership Down/ is the best book in the whole world. It was the basis for a smash hit 1978 film of the same name. I'm still recovering from that experience, as we all are.

/Watership Down/ Â© 1972 Richard Adams.
