/When a bird of prey snatches a baby rabbit, the rabbits suspect something much worse./

This thrilling adventure mixes naturalistic talking rabbits in the style of Watership Down together with psionic powers, teleporters, helpful robots and dangerous monsters.

Follow the rabbits of Oraculum Warren, their neighbours Deep Index Warren, the hi-tech Greenmint Warren and the secretive Mothership Down Warren in this beautifully-told fable. The rabbits will need all their faith and courage to survive the dangerous Witch Hiddil and its monstrous maze lair.

Warrens will fall, friendships will form, and mysterious strangers will interfere in this surprising story full of action and charm.
